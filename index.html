            <h2 class="timeline__content-title">December.16, 1773</h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">The Boston Tea Party was a protest held by American colonists, against the British Parliament for the imposed tax they had to pay. This tax was to gather money to pay the debt Britain was under. Britain thought the taxes for this were quite fair, but the American colonists didn't agree with this and didn't want to be taxed. This is what the whole protest was about. To be exact, in this protest Americans dressed up as “native Indians” (indigenous people) and got on colonist ships to throw Britain’s valuable tea into the water. This then led to Britain sending in their armies with full force.</p>

This tiny hut was built to mainly store gunpowder, but it was still one of the most important trading posts for the Hudson's Bay Company. This is because it was surrounded by trade communities, French and English to the east, Athabasca County to the north, and Oregon County to the west.</p>

            <p class="timeline__content-desc">By the year 1776, the Patiriots had control over the 13 colonies, and the 
              supporters of the crown could no longer stay. So many of the loyalists fled from America to Canada. A few 
              loyalists didn't establish their support of the crown allowing them to stay and later participate in the

            <h2 class="timeline__content-title">May.19, 1780</h2>
            <p class="timeline__content-desc">This unusual event occured when the sky appeared to darken during 
              afternoon hours. The darkness is assumed to be smoke from forest fires, in addition to thick fog 
              <i>and</i> terrible clime in the region. Letters wrote in that time period from revolutionary soldiers to
               common civilians, point to the fact that heave cloud cover also produced a certain colour in the sky. 
               Unlike now, when we have scientific technologies to predict what and why the sky darkened, people in the 
               1780s lacked these tools and interpreted it in religious terms; saying that judgement day had arrived or 
               was soon to come (Judgement day is a religous term used in Christianity to refer o the end of the world 
               when god decides everybody's fate).</p>

            <p class="timeline__content-desc">The treaty of paris was what officially recognized the independence of the United States of America from British power. This also meant a border between the British controlled regions and America, namely a border between British North America and the USA.

In addition to this, indigenous peoples in the American territory were given reserves and fishing rights for water bodies near Newfoundland were given to the Americans.</p>

This was in recognition of their alliance with Britain in the American revolution, since the loss in the civil war had caused them to lose their land. After the war had ended, many Mohawk leaders pressured the British government into making land reserves for their people.</p>

Throughout the journey, he and his group were put through severe conditions, and overall a really hard journey. They surprisingly traveled a long way in just 3 months, and were doing good. Unfortunately though, the group wasn't able to reach the Pacific Ocean, but at least learnt more about Canada's northwestern geography.</p>
